   <p>This is the most common meal for family gatherings in iran and its the meal that'll bring you and your whole family togther. Imagine all your khale's and daiee's around your grand parents
    all cheered up and happy and its all because of this delicious Marinated chicken, dont you dare think their happines is because of anything except the food, these are all brothers and sisters in their 40's they all hate eachother. 
    now that we got that out of they way lets get to the actual reason why your here the Damn recipe.
   </p>
   <strong>Ingredients</strong> 
   <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken</li>
    <li>2 onions</li>
    <li>saferon</li>
    <li>yogurt<em>(2 tablespoons)</em></li>
    <li>3 fresh limes</li>
    <li>seasonings</li>
   </ul> 
   <strong>Steps</strong>
   <ol>
    <li>Debone your chicken and cut it up into bitesize cubes</li>
    <li>Peel and cut your onions</li>
    <li>Put your chicken and oninons in a bowl then add the yogurt,saferon,seasonings and the juice of the limes</li>
    <li>Mix everything togther then cover the bowl with a plastic foil and leave it in the fridge overnight</li>
    <li>Recruit one of your Auntie's to put the pieces of chicken on skewers</li>
    <li>Hold one of your Uncle's at gun point and make him get the coals ready and all heated up(dont you dare make this kebab using anything but coal I know your addres)</li>
    <li>Put the chicken on the grill and flip them every 2 ro 3 minuts let them cook until their all nicely chared dont worry the food is not burnt its just chared</li>
    <li>serve the kebab with rice and grilled tomatoes</li>
   </ol>
   <p>And thats your recipe, I mean sure you could just ditch the skewers and the coal and bake the chicken in an oven and call it a day, but where is the fun in that? the whole point of this is the time you spend with your family in the hot wheather while wait an hour or two for your food slowly dieing of hunger.</p>
